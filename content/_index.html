                <p>
                    devabees is a small apiary close to picturesque Chester in the United Kingdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the spring and summer the devabees are moved out to locations around Delamere
                    where they can forage in numerous
                    wild flower meadows and orchards.
                    When Autumn comes, the devabees spend the winter in the more
                    sheltered accomodation offered by their home village. Thereby extending their season
                    and making collecting enough wintertime stores a much easier prospect for them.
                </p>
                <h2 class="h5"><strong>So what's the honey like?</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    Our locally bred devabees produce a glorious, light, bright floral honey that has proved
                    very popular with all who have tried it. One of the comments received from a devabees' fan
                    described it as "<em>liquid sunshine captured in a jar</em>". We can't think of a better
                    compliment for all of the hard work invested by the devabees.
                </p>
                <h2 class="h5"><strong>Prize winning devabees honey</strong></h2>
                <p>Our devabees honey has won various prizes including The Blackman Cup at the Cheshire Honey Show</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-10 offset-xs-1">
                <h2 class="h5"><strong>Cheshire Beekeeping Association</strong></h2>
                <p>devabees are members of the <a href="https://www.cheshire-bka.co.uk/">Cheshire Beekeeper's Association (CBKA)</a> and proud to be so.</p>
                <p>The members of the CBKA have made us extremely welcome, provided tons of help and useful knowledge and have turned out to be true friends.</p>
                <p>We can heartily recommend any Cheshire Beekeeper to become involved with CBKA and would urge any Beekeeper to get invovled with their local Association.</p>
                <h2 class="h5"><strong>Mount Pleasant Gardens</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="http://www.mountpleasantgardens.co.uk/">Mount Pleasant Gardens</a> are spectacular private gardens (part of the rhs recommended gardens)
                    where some of the devabees have their summertime quarters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gardens are open to the public and are well worth a visit. It is also possible to buy some
                    devabees honey at their shop (whilst stocks last). So you can have a pleasant day out along
                    with a sweet after taste by visiting <a href="https://www.mountpleasantgardens.co.uk/">Mount Pleasant Gardens</a>.

                            add propolis to strengthen the comb, it will go from cream to yellow to brown and almost black.

                            it is only about 17% water. That's when it can be called honey. They then put a
                            thin cap of wax over the cell to keep the honey in perfect
                            condition until it is needed.

                            At the height of summer the Honey Bee colony's population has reached its peak size. This can make it challenging to
                            spot the Queen in amongst them all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        However, it is what every Beekeeper wants to see; more bees equals a healthy
                        colony and the prospect of a good harvest.</p>

                            In a Honey Bee colony there is one fertile female, known as the Queen. She is entirely dependent upon
                            her daughters for all things; food and warmth. She has an abdomen that is longer than those of a
                            Worker Bee. For many Beekeeping tasks it is important to be able to find the Queen, which is often far
                            easier said than done!
